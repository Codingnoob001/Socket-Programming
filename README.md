# Socket-Programming

# Simple HTTP Server and Client Implementation

This project implements a basic HTTP server and client using socket programming. The server handles HTTP requests to serve static files, while a multithreaded version allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously.

- **Single-threaded HTTP Server**: Handles one HTTP request at a time, serving HTML files from the local directory.
- **Custom HTTP Client**: Connects to the server using a TCP connection, sends GET requests, and prints server responses.
- **Multithreaded HTTP Server**: Uses threading to handle multiple client requests concurrently.
